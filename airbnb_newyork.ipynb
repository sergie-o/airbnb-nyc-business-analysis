    "-\tListings with very low availability (close to 0 days) tend to have a wider spread in prices, including a few extremely high-priced outliers.\n",
    "\n",
    "-\tModerate to high availability (100–300 days) generally corresponds to lower median prices, suggesting that hosts keeping listings open most of the year might adopt more competitive pricing to attract bookings.\n",
    "\n",
    "-\tFully available listings (365 days) cluster in the mid-to-lower price range, indicating they are likely targeted at consistent occupancy rather than premium pricing.\n",
    "\n",
    "-\tThe interquartile range (IQR) narrows as availability increases, showing more price stability for highly available listings.\n",
    "\n",
    "-\tOverall, availability appears to influence pricing strategy, with low-availability listings more likely positioned as premium/short-term rentals, and high-availability listings geared toward steady, budget-conscious demand."

    "     F(3, 47828) = 214.99, **p < 0.0001** → Significant differences in prices exist between different availability categories.\n",
    "\n",
    "   - **Room Type Effect**:  \n",
    "     F(2, 47828) = 11,199.55, **p < 0.0001** → Room type is a very strong predictor of price variation.\n",
    "\n",
    "   - **Interaction Effect (Availability × Room Type)**:  \n",
    "     F(6, 47828) = 44.91, **p < 0.0001** → The impact of availability on price depends on the room type.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Key Insights**  \n",
    "   - *Entire home/apartment* listings consistently have the highest median prices across all availability levels.  \n",
    "\n",
    "   - Listings with **medium-to-high availability** (101–365 days) tend to have greater price variation, especially in the *Entire home/apartment* category.  \n",

    "   - *Shared rooms* remain the most affordable option regardless of availability.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Notable Observations**  \n",
    "   - Even in “No availability” listings, prices vary widely, suggesting some inactive or temporarily blocked listings still set premium prices.  \n",
    "\n",
    "   - Significant interaction means availability’s influence on price is **not uniform** — e.g., high availability boosts prices more for *Entire home/apartment* than for *Private rooms*.\n",

    "   - **For hosts**: Maximizing availability can be leveraged differently depending on room type to optimize revenue.  \n",

    "   - **For the platform**: Premium-tier marketing could target *Entire home/apartment* owners with high availability, as they show the largest spread and highest potential in price."

    "###  Business Objective\n",
    "The goal of this analysis was to explore how various factors — such as **neighbourhood location, room type, and availability** — influence Airbnb pricing in New York City. This investigation is aimed at identifying patterns that can help **hosts optimize their pricing strategy** and **assist the platform** in targeting premium listings for strategic promotion.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "###  Approach\n",
    "The analysis followed a structured **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** pipeline:\n",
    "1. **Data Cleaning & Preparation**  \n",
    "   - Removed unrealistic price values (e.g., prices above $500 for better interpretability).  \n",
    "   - Filtered out extreme outliers in variables such as minimum nights and number of reviews.  \n",
    "   - Handled missing values and standardized key variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Univariate Analysis**  \n",
    "   - Explored individual variables (price, minimum nights, number of reviews, availability) to understand their distributions.  \n",
    "   - Identified skewness in price and availability distributions, prompting filtering and categorization.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Bivariate Analysis with Hypothesis Testing**  \n",
    "   - **Price vs Neighbourhood Group**  \n",
    "     - *H₀*: Mean prices are equal across neighbourhood groups.  \n",
    "     - ANOVA showed significant differences (p < 0.0001). Manhattan emerged as the most expensive area.\n",
    "   - **Price vs Room Type**  \n",
    "     - *H₀*: Mean prices are equal across room types.  \n",
    "     - Strong statistical evidence (p < 0.0001) that *Entire home/apartment* commands the highest prices.\n",
    "   - **Price vs Availability**  \n",
    "     - *H₀*: Mean prices are equal across availability categories.  \n",
    "     - Significant differences found (p < 0.0001), with higher availability often associated with wider price ranges.\n",
    "   - **Multivariate Analysis – Price by Room Type & Availability**  \n",
    "     - Tested for interaction between room type and availability on price.  \n",
    "     - Significant interaction (p < 0.0001) — availability’s impact on price depends on the room type.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Geospatial Visualization**  \n",
    "   - Interactive maps revealed clear geographic clustering of high-priced listings in Manhattan and parts of Brooklyn.  \n",
    "   - Dropdown filters allowed borough-specific price exploration.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "###  Key Findings\n",
    "- **Location matters**: Manhattan listings are consistently priced higher than other boroughs.  \n",
    "- **Room type is a major driver of price**: Entire homes/apartments command significantly higher prices compared to private or shared rooms.  \n",
    "- **Availability has a complex effect**: High availability correlates with greater price variance, especially for Entire homes/apartments.  \n",
    "- **Interaction effects are important**: The relationship between availability and price is not uniform across room types.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "###  Business Implications\n",
    "- **For Hosts**:  \n",
    "  - Position properties in high-demand boroughs (e.g., Manhattan) and maintain high availability for premium pricing potential.  \n",
    "  - Entire home/apartment owners can benefit most from extended availability.\n",
    "- **For the Platform**:  \n",
    "  - Use predictive modeling on combined location, room type, and availability data to identify and promote high-value listings.  \n",
    "  - Create tailored recommendations for hosts to adjust availability based on room type to maximize earnings.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "**Conclusion**:  \n",
    "Through rigorous EDA, hypothesis testing, and visualization, this project demonstrated that Airbnb pricing in NYC is significantly shaped by **location**, **room type**, and **availability**, with strong interaction effects between these factors. These insights can directly inform strategic decisions for both hosts and the platform."
